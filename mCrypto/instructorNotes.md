# Crypto module overview

I think this module should have a project where the student needs to iteratively make an xor cipher by following the first few cryptopals examples.

After that, we will conduct a source review and use someone else's AES functions.

Both solutions will be used to encrypt local data such as strings and files, as well as network traffic.
