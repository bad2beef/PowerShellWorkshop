**This is Studly McBeefy’s base PowerShell workshop.** The aim of this workshop
is to get you competent in PowerShell quickly. There are no quirky gimmicks or
“master class” shenaniganry here. My approach is simple. We’ll walk through a
bunch of things you should know and see what happens. If you’re the curious
type you’ll dig deeper in each area on your own. If not, you should still be
able to fumble though quite a bit. At the end of it all you should be able to
read a lot of the PowerShell out there, and be able to churn out simple code to
accomplish a wide range of tasks for better or for worse.

_Other, more focused bolt-ons to the workshop may exist. Also, they may not._

Ideally, you’ll be taking this workshop with me. The content herein has been
created to facilitate guided exploration. If you’re doing this on your own a
few things may not be so clear. Still, in the interests of saving your from
skiddiedom, open materials are provided. There is enough here to provide the
“what”, but the “why”, “when” and “how” may require some additional
instruction.

So, what’s in the box?
 * __PowerShell Workshop.ps1__ – The curriculum. _This is the meat._
 * __examples/*__ – Simple example code to provide somewhat realistic examples
of PowerShell usages. _Delicious potatoes, of the Yukon Gold variety._
 * __Vagrantfile__ – A simple Vagrant configuration to allow you stand up a
quick and easy sandbox for learning. This isn’t necessary, but its advised you
use it. _Its fresh sausage gravy on top._

Enjoy!
